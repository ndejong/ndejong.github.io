title: A Catalogue Of Unusual Things In The Philippines

A collection of things in the Philippines that are surprising, different, unusual and often 
remarkable.  Everytime you observe oddball things like these, you really have to see them as 
opportunities to teach, educate and improve.

### We are installing the new fibre-cable sir!
At a notoriously busy intersection in Makati, Manila I found a crew installing new a new fibre cable across 
the street, in the middle of the day - awesome!

### No seriously, we are the guys installing a new fibre-cable sir...
A week after spotting the guys installing cable across a busy intersection I found another 
fibre-install marvel with a crew digging a "micro-trench" - the trench is about ~15 centimeters 
deep and carries critical infrastructure.  After 3 months the trench was still not repaired or 
correctly covered leading to mototcycle accidents and local residents to address the hazard by 
filling them in with dirt and rocks.

### Infrastructure providers don't co-operate
It's stunning to observe how deep-rooted the rivalry is between infrastructure companies in the 
Philippines, in the telecommunications industry this really stands out.  It's not uncommon to see 
three or more sets of the same infrastructure installed right next to one another even when it's 
ugly, gets-in-the-way and frequently just dangerous.

### Quikshare WIFI and dancing-pigs
I found myself riding on a medium-distance bus for a few hours and discovered a [dancing-pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_pigs)
attached to the back of the seat.  The promise is for free content using your mobile handset, 
the problem is that the software breaks the security model of your handset to do so - ouch!
